const questions = [
  "**Q: What is a hackathon?**",
  "**A**: *A Hackathon is a combination of the words 'hack' and 'marathon'. At XdHacks Mini, we believe  the word 'hack' means to create. Itâ€™s an event where people come together and use technology to transform ideas into reality. Additionally, students can create projects, attend workshops, meet new people, improve their programming, and have lots of fun!*",
  "",
  "**Q: How does a virtual hackathon work?**",
  "**A**: *XdHacks-Climate Code takes place exclusively online. Registration will be held on HackHub exclusively and discord will be the communication platform during the Hackathon where webinars and Q &A sessions will be hosted. Technical instructions will be sent to you via email before the Hackathon begins.*",
  "",
  "**Q: What activities are planned?**",
  "**A**: *There will be webinars, online side games and plenty of other fun activities to keep you busy. We will have some online team building sessions, so feel free to register alone!*",
  "",
  "**Q: What am I expected to create?**",
  "**A**: *Our event encourages students to develop their product as much as they can, we do not expect a product ready to be put on the market. Prototyping is a huge part of product creation and, at XdHacks, we are celebrating the creativity and innovative ideas highschool students have to approach a real-world issue.*",
  "",
  "**Q: Are there participation requirements?**",
  "**A**: *The only participation requirements are that you are a current high-school student with internet access. No coding experience is required!*"
